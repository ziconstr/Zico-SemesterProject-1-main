## Description

The Semester Project at Noroff School of Technology serves as a comprehensive course assignment, showcasing students' proficiency in both creative and technical aspects aligned with the first-semester curriculum. This encompasses the application of design principles, project management, communication technology, and hands-on development utilizing HTML/CSS.

My aim was to design a dynamic webpage for a science museum, catering to primary and middle school children, as well as families with kids. The website strives to provide valuable information while fostering engagement, ultimately motivating visitors to explore the museum in real life.
